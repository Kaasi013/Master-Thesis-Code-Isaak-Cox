The code made in my thesis is listed here. This contains the neutronics and thermal hydraulics for the segmented molten salt reactor. The thesis can be found on https://www.tudelft.nl/tnw/over-faculteit/afdelingen/radiation-science-technology/research/research-groups/reactor-physics-and-nuclear-materials/publications/msc-theses

The code: 'Multiple segments', is the final code
The code: 'Point kinetics + Thermal hydraulics with analysis', are the MSRE benchmarks with an old version of the code
The code: 'Serpent geometry script', contains the code creating the geometry files for Serpent simulations and the fission shape calculations
